# Statement of Work

## 1. Problem Statement
Managing employee information manually becomes difficult as the number of employees increases. 
There is a need for a simple system that can store, retrieve, update, 
and delete employee records in an organized way without using a complex database.

## 2. Scope of the Project
This project focuses on creating a basic file-based Employee CRUD system using Python.  
The system allows:
- Adding new employee records
- Viewing all employee records
- Updating existing employee details
- Deleting records from the system

The system uses a CSV file for storage, making it easy to handle and 
maintain for small to medium datasets.

## 3. Target Users
- Students learning Python and file handling  
- Beginner developers who want to understand CRUD operations  
- Small-scale users who need a lightweight employee record system  

## 4. High-Level Features
- Simple text-based interface  
- File-based storage using CSV  
- Full CRUD support (Create, Read, Update, Delete)  
- Easy to extend into GUI or database in the future  
- No external dependencies required to run
